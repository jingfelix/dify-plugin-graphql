# Privacy Policy for GraphQL Plugin

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date of Last Update]

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how the GraphQL Plugin for Dify ("Plugin", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our plugin to interact with GraphQL APIs through the Dify platform. This policy applies solely to the Plugin and not to the Dify platform itself or the third-party GraphQL services you choose to connect to.

## 2. Data We Process
The Plugin acts as an intermediary to facilitate your interactions with a GraphQL API of your choice. When you use the Plugin, the following types of data are processed by the Plugin but are primarily managed by you and the Dify platform:

*   **GraphQL Endpoint URL**: The URL of the GraphQL server you provide for the Plugin to connect to.
*   **GraphQL Queries and Mutations**: The specific GraphQL queries or mutations you instruct the Plugin to send.
*   **Variables**: Any variables you provide to be sent along with your GraphQL queries or mutations.
*   **HTTP Headers**: Custom HTTP headers you configure, which may include authentication tokens (e.g., API keys, Bearer tokens) required by your GraphQL API.
*   **API Responses**: The data returned by your GraphQL API in response to the queries or mutations sent.

The Plugin itself does **not** store this information persistently. It is processed in memory for the duration of the request and response cycle.

## 3. How We Use Data
The data listed above is used solely for the following purposes:

*   To send your GraphQL requests (queries, mutations, variables, and headers) to the GraphQL Endpoint URL you specify.
*   To receive the response from the GraphQL API and make it available to you within the Dify platform.
*   Authentication headers are used exclusively to authenticate your requests with your chosen GraphQL API.

We do not use this data for any other purpose, such as profiling, analytics, or advertising.

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties
The Plugin itself does not share your data with any third parties, except for the following:

*   **Your Configured GraphQL API**: The Plugin transmits your GraphQL queries, mutations, variables, and headers to the GraphQL Endpoint URL that you provide. The privacy practices of that GraphQL API are governed by its own privacy policy.
*   **Dify Platform**: The Plugin operates within the Dify platform. How Dify handles data is governed by Dify's own privacy policy and terms of service.

We do not sell, rent, or trade your information.

## 5. Data Retention
The Plugin is stateless and does **not** retain any of your data (GraphQL endpoint, queries, variables, headers, or responses) after a request-response cycle is complete. Any logging or data retention is subject to the policies and configurations of:
*   The Dify platform itself.
*   The GraphQL API service you are interacting with.

Please refer to their respective privacy policies for details on data retention.

## 6. User Rights
As the Plugin does not store your personal data, any requests regarding access, correction, deletion, or portability of data should be directed to:
*   The administrators of the Dify platform you are using.
*   The administrators of the GraphQL API service you are interacting with.

You have the right to configure or stop using the Plugin at any time.

## 7. Security
We rely on the security measures implemented by the Dify platform to protect data while it is being processed by the Plugin. If you are providing sensitive information like authentication tokens, ensure you trust the security of the Dify environment and the GraphQL API you are connecting to.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Plugin's information page or documentation. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
